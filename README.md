# Bingo Blitz

Bingo Blitz is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) built with React.js and improves upon its previous version which was created in Visual Basic.

This project initially started during my time volunteering at my local seniors homes during their weekly Bingo nights. There was a lot of noise created with manually cranking the ball cage or using the pneumatic blower "cage". Not to mention, I would often notice many seniors who could not hear me properly and would miss potential bingos as a result.

The Bingo Blitz application therefore solves two major problems:
1.  Digitizing calling Bingo balls and thereby eliminating noise caused by cages/blowers.
2.  Creating a presentable graphical interface for hard-of-hearing seniors to avoid missed bingos.
